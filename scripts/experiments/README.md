This section describes how to run experiments and update the AIICE benchmark leaderboard.

The repository provides multiple experimental setups for different models. Each model is defined by a separate configuration file located in the [`configs`](scripts/experiments/configs) directory.

---

To run an experiment, use the following command:

```bash
uv run scripts/experiments/cli.py \
    --config scripts/experiments/configs/baseline_mean.yaml
````

This will execute the selected model configuration and produce evaluation reports for the specified sea regions.

---

After an experiment is completed, you can add its results for a specific sea to the global leaderboard using:

```bash
uv run --project=scripts scripts/experiments/convert.py \
    --model baseline_mean \
    --sea "Kara Sea" \
    --forecast_len 54 \
    --step 1w \
    --report "outputs/baseline_mean/Kara Sea/report.yaml" \
    --csv docs/assets/leaderboard.csv
```

To add results for all seas at once, point `--report` to the output directory (subdirectories are treated as sea names, each should contain a YAML file):

```bash
uv run --project=scripts scripts/experiments/convert.py \
    --model baseline_mean \
    --forecast_len 54 \
    --step 1w \
    --report outputs/baseline_mean \
    --csv docs/assets/leaderboard.csv
```

This command:

* extracts metrics from the YAML report(s)
* associates the results with the given forecast length and step
* updates (or creates) the central CSV leaderboard, deduplicating by model, sea, metric, forecast length, and step

### FNO baseline

A Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) baseline is provided via `fno.py`, with one
config per scenario from Table 1 of the AIICE paper. The model wraps
`neuralop.models.FNO` as a "time-as-channel" forecaster
(`(B, T_in, H, W) -> (B, T_out, H, W)`) and is trained per sea.

Unlike the convolutional baselines, FNO uses an internal train/val split for
early stopping. The last `val_years` of the configured `start_date .. end_date`
window are held out for validation; the benchmark window itself
(`end_date .. dataset_end`) is unchanged.

To run all seven paper scenarios on the five leaderboard seas:

```bash
for sc in L1 L2 L3 L4 S1 S2 S3; do
    uv run --project=scripts scripts/experiments/cli.py \
        --config scripts/experiments/configs/fno_${sc}.yaml
done
```

The reproducibility of the published numbers relies on three pinned settings
inside each config: `seed: 42`, `target_modes: 16`, and `val_years: 4`. The
spectral mode count is automatically clamped to the Nyquist limit
`spatial_dim // 2` for narrow sea crops (Sea of Japan, Chukchi Sea).

### HF-Mamba baseline

See scripts [here](./FH-Mamba/Dockerfile). This environment was tested on NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs.

The causal-conv1d and mamba-ssm extensions are compiled for compute capability sm_70; if you use a different GPU, rebuild the image with `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` set to your architecture.
If training fails with a `CUDNN_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED` error, comment out the `total_flops = flops.total()` line in `trainer.py` to disable FLOPs estimation. This does not affect training results.
In our experiments, we increased `hid_S` to 32 and `hid_T_channels` to 24 in `config.py`. 

Sea ice concentration images were resized to 56x56, and the temporal-spatial patch was set to (1, 2, 2) in the `HilbertScan3DMambaBlock` initialization within `FH_Mamba.py`.
